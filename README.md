# Midwest-dataset-project-using-R
This project explores the Midwest dataset: a collection of demographic and socioeconomic information for counties in the Midwestern United States.\n
The primary motivation is to investigate potential disparities across racial groups and their socioeconomic implications, such as poverty and education levels.

## Dataset

The dataset used is `midwest` from the `ggplot2` package. It contains 437 rows and 28 variables, including:

- **Demographics**: Population counts and percentages by race
- **Socioeconomics**: Poverty rates, education levels
- **Geographic**: Area, state, and metro classification

## Tools Used

- **R** and **R Markdown** for analysis and reporting
- Libraries:
  - `tidyverse`
  - `dplyr`
  - `ggplot2`
  - `broom`
 
## Key Analyses

- Total population and population density by state
- Poverty rate comparisons across states
- Correlation and linear regression between poverty and:
  - Total population
  - Population density
- Racial composition analysis (Black, White, Other)
- Grouping races to explore their influence on poverty
- Hypothesis testing for racial impact on poverty rates

## Findings

- **Population density** and **total population** show weak correlation with poverty rates.
- States with higher percentages of minority populations tend to have higher average poverty rates.
- Racial disparities in poverty exist and are evident in the visual and statistical analysis.
